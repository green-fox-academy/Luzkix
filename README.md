#**Hello everyone, this is mine main Green Fox repository with various homeworks as i learned Java during Foundation and Orientation phases:**

#**In Project phase it was all about teamwork and buildig a "big" RESTful application, with many endpoints, a lot of logic and implementations of new technologies, and of course testing...a lot of testing...:**

-- repo to be added when app is finished and forked -- the app is a result of 3-4 months of work of 4 developers (including me). There was like 40-50 user stories to be implemented, often overlaping so we could also learn from others. We worked in 2-week sprints. We used git branches, did mutual code reviews, trying to simulate work as if we worked in company.

#**Note: Before I started with the full course I participated on a month lenght Green Fox coding camp which focused on html and basics of JavaSript :**
